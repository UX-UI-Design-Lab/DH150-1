## Description ##
This project aims to add useful functions to Venmo (an application that makes handling finances and transactions easier) and 
improve the user interface.  As a college student, I use Venmo a lot in transactions with friends and strangers. There are 
great existing functions, but the app is unable to perform tasks like charging or paying multiple people at once, recording a
receipt and who bought what item, and an easier way to visualize spending. Thus, this prototype aims to solve those three 
tasks as the purpose of this high-fidelity prototype is to create a interactive,functioning version of the product. First, I 
created a wireframe and wireflow, then learned how to use Adobe XD and installed a toolkit to achieve a more realistic iPhone 
look, and then digitized my wireframe and flow. By linking certain buttons, the prototype is interactive. Careful design and 
detail allows the application to appear as if it were reallistically being run on an iPhone. Then, I had a user do a test run,
to see if the three tasks worked and no dead ends were hit.

## Graphic Design ##

PrototypeFrames.png

+1:  At least three distinctive screen designs that represent user-interface design with standard graphical components (ex. Material ui component)
+1: Thoughtful description about how you made the decisions for the graphical interface design (ex. Color scheme).

## Wireflow ##


+1: At least one sequence of the user interaction flow was presented with screen designs with and arrow_lines 
+1: Complete interaction sequences for the three features were clearly presented in the wireflow with screen designs

## Prototype URL ##

+1: (The active URL of) a prototype presented in the web document
+4: The prototype provides interactivity of one full sequence of the task without dead-end


## Extra Credit ##
- Video of User testing the prototype
- Fixed the end of the last task because it was a dead end.
