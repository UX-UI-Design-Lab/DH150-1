## Evaluation of Venmo and Wescom Banking

I chose to focus my project on the finance/banking community, because Venmo and Wescom are apps that I personally use a lot. They make handling finances and transactions easier, and I hope to improve them so that they can better cater their functions towards users. Venmo is an app that allows people to transact money. It is connected to one's bank account, so that the user can transfer money in or out of their Venmo account. One of the best things about this app is that it allows people to go out without cash and coins. Many people use the app, probably mostly high school and college young adults, so it is an easy, popular form of money transaction. When going out to eat with many friends, it tends to be easier to have one person pay and the rest Venmo that one person than to ask the waiter to split the bill into several parts. Additionally, exact change is easy to do on the app, whereas in real life it can be annoying or tedious to have to pay, for example, 63 cents. While I enjoy using Venmo because it is simple to use and easy to transact money with friends or strangers, there are functions that I would like to improve, so my overall evaluation is a 2. Wescom is a banking app tailored to those that use Wescom services. The app is meant to make banking easy. For example, you can cash checks through your phone, instead of making a trip down to the bank. Additionally, you can check your accounts, transfer funds, and more. The app is similar to their website, but the app form makes it easier to navigate on a phone. It is definitely tailored to expert users, so it can be difficult for me to understand how the app functions, so my overall evaluation is a 2.

#1: Visibility of system status

Venmo: Evaluation - 3

Good - Loading sign when entering the app and when a payment or request is being sent. The personal balance is apparent when user is confirming to pay to the recipient. Incomplete requests or payments to the user are noticeable.

Bad - User's personal balance in Venmo should be more apparent (whether it be the first thing seen or putting it on the home page). The home page is always the user's friends' payments to other people; the purpose of Venmo is for the user to pay or receive money, and the homescreen serves no purpose to accomplish these goals. The homescreen should be the screen to pay and request people money, or the icon should be larger and more noticeable. The other options on the homescreen are a globe, where the user can see anyone's payments. This is unrelated to the user. The user can also click the single friend icon and see his or her own transactions. This seems like it is the user's profile, but it is not; the user can see transactions, but no total amount gained or lost, nor can he or she see their personal balance.

Wescom: Evaluation - 2

Good - Loading signs when entering the app and clicking on an icon. The menu labels/icons are clear and have drop down menus to see more options in the sidebar. The drop down menu shows many options.

Bad - The configuration of the home screen is a bit confusing. There are 9 icons that correspond to some parts of the "Main Menu." The user can access these through the sidebar, so it seems redundant to have these. Perhaps these are the most used functions, in which case this can be helpful to an expert user. When clicking on an icon such as BillPayer, more icons to schedule, manage payees, and pending & history show up. At first glance, these seem like suggestions or instructions of the icon function. It is not clear that the user is supposed to choose one of these icons to proceed forward. Additionally, the app seems to run a bit slow, as there is always a loading sign when clicking any icon.

#2: Match between system and the real world

Venmo: Evaluation - 2

Good - The buttons change color; when the user clicks the blue pay button, it changes to green for confirmation. When writing a pay or request sheet, the title will change to Pay or Request when the user clicks one of the options. When the user gets paid, the amount will be a + sign and green, and when the user pays someone, the amount will be - and red. The icons are recognizable and reflect their true function; for example, to pay or request, the top right button is a notepad with a $ sign on it and pencil to write.

Bad - The color of the buttons for pay and request are the same. The user may accidentally pay a friend when meaning to request from a friend, because both buttons are blue and change to green. It can be hard to notice that the title changed to Pay because the user's focus is more likely to be at the bottom of the screen and notice the color change, rather than the text change. The term "private" implies that all the information would be private from other users, however, private mode still shows the user's captions and who he or she interacted with.

Wescom: Evaluation 2

Good - The icons seem to reflect the associated function. For example, the "Card Center" icon is a credit card and "Car Buying Service" has a car icon. They use common icons, such as the location icon to indicate "Find ATM/Branch." The app is relatively intuitive to use, as there are commonly used icons and clearly depicted icons.

Bad - Everything is the same color. The user must rely on differing icons and some text to navigate the app. Thus, the user must be familiar with banking terminology and the typical Wescom functions. Similar to an iPhone homescreen, the user can swipe, but there is no function to this, as there are no other pages to go to. The user must swipe specifically the left side of the screen or tap the icon with 3 lines to access the menu options

#3: User control and freedom

Venmo: Evaluation - 2

Good - The caption serves as a reminder to the user and recipient of the reason behind the transaction. This is helpful if the user forget why x amount of money was paid or requested. There is a clear cancel sign if the user decides he or she does not want to pay or request someone. There are no pop-up ads.

Bad - The caption often autofills emojis whether the user would like that or not. It can be annoying to have to retype the caption or use a different word to avoid an emoji popping up. There is no option to save a draft. The user can easily cancel and discard a charge, however if he or she needs to go back to check the other person's username or recalculate the amount, the user must discard the working pay/request to go look through his or her friend list and then redraft a new pay/request (caption, amount, person). The user cannot cannot charge or pay multiple people; this makes it difficult on the user to have to remember who he or she has not paid/requested, the amount(s), and takes more time than necessary. Many people use Venmo when going out to eat with friends, and the person who paid will request their friends. If they split the bill equally, it becomes tedious for the user to charge the exact same amount to each person, as they have to create a new request each time.

Wescom: Evaluation - 2

Good - There are cancel buttons for functions where there are several options. There is a clear back arrow for when the user goes into an information center such as "Card Center" or "Account Center." There is a small > for buttons that the user can press and see more information.

Bad - While there is not much fear about getting stuck in part of the app, there is a fear of navigating incorrectly. Personally, I am scared that as a novice user, I will mess something up with the bank account or amount present. Additionally, some aspects can be hard to undo. For example, there was recently an option to "Enable Express Access," in which the phone owner/user can click on the Wescom app and see all the amounts on the homescreen without logging in. The function of what Express Access was not clear in the brief description, and so I pressed Enable, in fear that if I cancelled, I would not be able to have that option again. However, I did not like that anyone with access to my phone could view my banking account. It was incredibly hard to find where Express Access's settings were; it should have been clear from the blurb where to find this function if I wanted to turn it off/on in later times.

#4: Consistency and standards

Venmo: Evaluation - 1

Good - The location of the buttons is consistent and the button icons are indicative of their functions. There is a side menu that indicates more menu options. The app is relatively intuitive to use. The user can swipe or tap to pull up the side menu and tap to change what the screen shows.

Bad - The user's personal profile and information is not as clear as seeing the user's friends'/community interactions. "Home" indicates that it would be the user's profile, but in fact the user must click his or her own name to reach their profile. "Home" brings the user to the homescreen which shows other people's transactions.

Wescom: Evaluation - 2

Good - The location of the buttons is consistent and the icons are all different.

Bad - The icons mostly all deal with an aspect of banking, so it can be difficult to locate exactly which function the user would like to use, as the text is very small. The icons under a function are pretty similar and don't make much sense. For example, under SnapDeposit, there is Deposit and Pending & History. The two nested buttons are the same as the SnapDeposit button, but Deposit has a play symbol and pending has a search symbol; the reasoning behind this is not so clear. Additionally, it is unclear whether or not you can rearrange the 9 homescreen icons to be tailored to the user. It would be interesting if this could reflect an iPhone's homescreen, where the user can drag and relocate icons to their personal preference.

#5: Error prevention

Venmo: Evaluation - 2

Good - Confirmation of last 4 digits of recipient's phone number when paying a significant amount to someone you are not Venmo "friends" with. There is a pay confirmation, request confirmation, and discard confirmation.

Bad - There is no confirmation of "Are you sure you want to send to x person?" when the recipient is friends with the user. The buttons for paying vs requesting are the same color, but it might be more helpful to have different colors.

Wescom: Evaluation - 1

Good - When making a SnapDeposit, there are instructions about how to correctly take the photo for the deposit to work. Additionally, if the photo is insufficient, an error message will pop up and indicate reasons for why it did not work. For security measures, the app will automatically log the user out after some inactivity.

Bad -The error message makes it seem like the image is too large and too small. The error message can be written to be more clear, indicating possible reasons for why the image did not work.

#6: Recognition rather than recall

Venmo: Evaluation - 2

Good - User's top people that he or she interacts with and friends show up as suggestions to pay. The user can also directly click the information button to view their profile.

Bad - User must build up a network of friends before this function is available. A novice user will need to recall someone's user handle. If the user would like to pay or request someone who is not one of his or her "top friends," he or she will need to recall part of the recipient's name in order for the handle to pop up.

Wescom: Evaluation - 3

Good - The icons are recognizable and expert users will be familiar with the app after using it for some time.

Bad - Users must be familiar with the terminologies and functions that Wescom provides. This makes it hard for users that are just starting to handle their own finances to navigate easily and quickly. There are several logins or security measures that users must remember. However, this is also important because users are dealing with money.

#7: Flexibility and efficiency of use

Venmo: Evaluation - 2

Good - There are functions to add/subtract and multiply/divide when making a Venmo pay or request. The user can also scan another Venmo user's code rather than type in the handle. It is also easy to add friends on Venmo, after knowing their handle.

Bad - It can be difficult to find people on Venmo through typing their full name. It can be annoying to type someone's handle, because as more people use the app, more usernames are taken. Thus, many handle names include dashes and arbitrary numbers. The functions to do math (to figure out tax or splitting the bill, etc) are not prominent. Though they are right next to the numbers, it seems that many users are unaware that these functions actually work to benefit the user. However, I still see many users pulling out the calculator app to calculate the bill, which is inefficient. This indicates that the functions need to be more clear (bigger, different colors, or something). It is also unclear that the user must click on their name to view their profile and that the small button next to their photo is how to pull up the scan code. It can be more time consuming for the user, especially a novice user, to try and figure out these functions when trying to complete a transaction, because it was not clear enough.

Wescom: Evaluation - 3

Good - The homescreen serves as a shortcut to 9 menu options that users may tend to use the most.

Bad - This app caters more towards expert users than novice users. Novice users may feel overwhelmed with the different functions while not completely understanding banking and finances. There are so many menu options grouped together and it takes time to try and go through to understand each and every one of them.

#8: Aesthetic and minimalist design

Venmo: Evaluation - 1

Good - The color scheme is consistent; the blue and white from the app icon is the same blue and white that shows up in the app. There are no distracting background colors; the header is blue, the screen is white, and the writing is in black and grey (and green and red for amounts). The visuals support the user goals and communicate function, indicating a high signal to noise ratio. The blue is nice to look at, and indicates trustworthiness which is important with monetary issues at hand. Additionally, blue is a commonly liked color, making it a safe choice for an app.

Wescom: Evaluation - 2

Good - The color theme is uniform; shades of blue and a white/grey color that matches their logo. While the background is blue, the user can slightly see several Wescom logos. Blue again indicates trustworthiness and is well liked, so users may subconciously feel secure in trusting Wescom with their banking needs.

Bad - While the visuals support the user goals, the app looks a bit boring and old school. Perhaps this is the look that the designers were going for, as it could translate across as experience and establish more trust. However, with the advancements of technology today, and having competitors like Chase banking or Bank of America, Wescom's app design is decent but not as aesthetic or personal as the others may be. For example, Bank of America's icons are photos of people smiling or interacting, things that may let the user feel a sense of happiness when using that app or website.

#9: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors

Venmo: Evaluation - 2

Good - A note/caption is required with each pay or request, so if a user tries to pay or request money without inserting a caption, a warning and example of a caption will pop up, preventing the user from following through with his or her actions, but also providing a solution.

Bad - There are no drafts to save. If the user starts a pay or request, there is no way to save the work on the charge and go back to the homescreen or other functions. If the user sends money to the wrong person, there is not much that can be done to reverse the error; there is no undo button, as the money has been sent already. The user can request that money back from the recipient, but relies on the recipient to return the money.

Wescom: Evaluation - 2

Good - An error message will pop up when the user tries to proceed forward when the previous step was wrong. The message will convey what to fix.

Bad - The message error is not clear and can be contradictory. The message error could be written better; instead of a photo of the check being too big and too small and try again, the message could say that the photo is either too big or too small, try flattening the check and trying again. There are no save draft functions, the user either proceeds to submit or cancels.

#10: Help and documentation

Venmo: Evaluation - 1

Good - There is a clear help section in the sidebar menu that loads 3 options (Browse FAQs, Contact Us, and My Support Tickets). The user can search topics in the FAQs or scroll through popular topics and several articles. The FAQ seems to be organized well; there are sections regarding signing up, transferring to the bank, cards, payments and requests, etc. The user can click on an article and will be brought to a detailed page with bolded questions and answers. The Contact Us tab can redirect the user to the FAQs or the user can choose to email, chat, or call Venmo. It is also helpful that there is a tab to check the hours of operation of Venmo.

Bad - Not entirely sure what "My Support Tickets" do; there is no explanation and nothing when the user clicks the tab because the user has no support tickets currently. Additionally, the "Chat with Us" tab does not seem to be working as it says it "could not connect, try again later."

Wescom: Evaluation - 2

Good - There is a section to "Contact Us" that provides help in finding an ATM, scheduling an appointment, calling, live chat, or emailing Wescom. These icons are in the sidebar as well as the bottom bar of the home screen.

Bad - There is no clear FAQ section for users who are in need of a quick fix and cannot wait on the phone or for an email. Thus, it is not easy to search for answers and users will stay confused about their problems.
