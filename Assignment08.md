## Description ##
> This project aims to add useful functions to Venmo (an application that makes handling finances and transactions easier) and improve the user interface.  As a college student, I use Venmo a lot in transactions with friends and strangers. There are 
great existing functions, but the app is unable to perform tasks like charging or paying multiple people at once, recording a
receipt and who bought what item, and an easier way to visualize spending. Thus, this prototype aims to solve those three 
tasks as the purpose of this high-fidelity prototype is to create a interactive,functioning version of the product. First, I 
created a wireframe and wireflow, then learned how to use Adobe XD and installed a toolkit to achieve a more realistic iPhone 
look, and then digitized my wireframe and flow. By linking certain buttons, the prototype is interactive. Careful design and 
detail allows the application to appear as if it were reallistically being run on an iPhone. Then, I had a user do a test run,
to see if the three tasks worked and no dead ends were hit.

> The audit task last week showed that Venmo's blue and white was not enough contrast. Thus, I switched to a darker blue; I found the color on one of the iOS ui toolkits. I wanted to keep the overall color scheme as blue and white, as blue indicates trustworthiness, stability, and loyalty. In order to not have too many distracting colors, I stuck with black and grey for icons and text as it provides a very clean look. I used red and green, also provided in the toolkit, to indicate losses and gains, respectively. This makes natural sense, with red indicating negative and green indicating positive. I indicated pay and request as green and red, respectively. When talking to other peers (potential users), we all agreed that this made the most natural sense to us, despite "pay" technically meaning the user is losing money. The reason I wanted to distinguish between the two is because I have often pressed the wrong buttons since they were color coded the same. When messages pop up, such as cancel confirmation, success, or adding a caption, I chose to make the background more opaque, to show off the message more. This way, the user is drawn to the error message, confirmation, or success. Finally, I used icons from the Noun Project and chose ones that were simple and easily recognized.

>> At the end of the last task, my prototype hit a dead end, so I fixed that by adding another frame and redoing a couple of the arrow links.
