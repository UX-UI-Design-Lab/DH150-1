1 The first thing you’ll want to articulate is the essence of your product,
service, or experience. Offer context, the main thrust of your idea, why it’s
different, and any call to action you’re making. Try to succinctly explain it
in less than a minute.
02 You’ll want your pitch to be clear and unambiguous, so don’t get bogged
down in the details. Sell your idea by sharing how and why it counts.
03 Next you’ll want to get that story into some kind of format. It could be a
pamphlet, a website, a book, or a presentation. You may need more than
one. You may need a graphic designer, videographer, or writer to help.
04 You’ll likely communicate differently with different audiences. Make sure
that as you Create a Pitch you think about telling stories of varying lengths
and in varying degrees of detail. What are the short, medium, and long
versions of your pitch?

As a college student, I am interested in saving money, quickly paying my friends back or being paid back, and
seeing how much money I have left to spend that day, week, month, or year. This application allows for all of these tasks 
to happen in one place rather than multiple apps or spreadsheet, making it easy to keep track of everything. The functions
of this application cater to anyone looking for a simple way to record finances and transact money.



Venmo allows you to pay and request money from your friends. At its core, Venmo provides a social way to pay your 
friends when you owe them money and don't want to deal with cash.Mar 1, 2020
