Evaluation of **Venmo** and **Wescom Banking**
--------------------------------------------------

__#1: Visibility of system status__
> Venmo: Evaluation - 3
>> _Good_ - Loading sign when entering the app. The personal balance is apparent when user is confirming to pay to the recipient. 
>
>> _Bad_ - User's personal balance in Venmo should be more apparent (whether it be the first thing seen or putting it on the home page). The home page is always the user's friends' payments to other people; the purpose of Venmo is for the user to pay or receive money, and _the homescreen serves no purpose to accomplish these goals_. The homescreen should be the screen to pay and request people money, or the icon should be larger and more noticeable. The other options on the homescreen are a globe, where the user can see anyone's payments. This is unrelated to the user. The user can also click the single friend icon and see his or her own transactions. This seems like it is the user's profile, but it is not; the user can see transactions, but no total amount gained or lost, nor can he or she see their personal balance. 


__#2: Match between system and the real world__
> Venmo: Evaluation - 2
>> _Good_ - The buttons change color; when the user clicks the blue pay button, it changes to green for confirmation. When writing a pay or request sheet, the title will change to Pay or Request when the user clicks one of the options. When the user gets paid, the amount will be a + sign and green, and when the user pays someone, the amount will be - and red. The icons are recognizable and reflect their true function; for example, to pay or request, the top right button is a notepad with a $ sign on it and pencil to write. 
>
>>_Bad_ - The color of the buttons for pay and request are the same. The user may accidentally pay a friend when meaning to request from a friend, because both buttons are blue and change to green. It can be hard to notice that the title changed to Pay because the user's focus is more likely to be at the bottom of the screen and notice the color change, rather than the text change. The term "private" implies that all the information would be private from other users, however, private mode still shows the user's captions and who he or she interacted with. 

__#3: User control and freedom__
> Venmo: Evaluation - 2
>> _Good_ - The caption serves as a reminder to the user and recipient of the reason behind the transaction. This is helpful if the user forget why x amount of money was paid or requested. There is a clear cancel sign if the user decides he or she does not want to pay or request someone. 
>
>>_Bad_ - The caption often autofills emojis whether the user would like that or not. It can be annoying to have to retype the caption or use a different word to avoid an emoji popping up. There is no option to save a draft. The user can easily cancel and discard a charge, however if he or she needs to go back to check the other person's username or recalculate the amount, the user must discard the working pay/request to go look through his or her friend list and then redraft a new pay/request (caption, amount, person). The user cannot cannot charge or pay multiple people; this makes it difficult on the user to have to remember who he or she has not paid/requested, the amount(s), and takes more time than necessary. Many people use Venmo when going out to eat with friends, and the person who paid will request their friends. If they split the bill equally, it becomes tedious for the user to charge the exact same amount to each person, as they have to create a new request each time.

**#4: Consistency and standards

Example: button label (login-), function of icon (go back to home), location of the icon/menu/layout

location of buttons always the smae

**#5: Error prevention

Venmo:
> _Good_ - Confirmation of last 4 digits of recipient's phone number when paying a significant amount to someone you are not Venmo "friends" with. discard confirmation. pay confirmation
bad - easy to mistype amount or forget the decimal 

**#6: Recognition rather than recall

> _Good_ - User's top people that he or she interacts with and friends show up as suggestions to pay. User can also directly click the information button to view their profile.
> _Bad_ - User must build up a network of friends before this function is available. A novice user will need to recall someone's user handle. 

**#7: Flexibility and efficiency of use

> Good - functions like adding or multiplying in the app and can quickly scan code rather than type
> Bad - these functions are not prominent and can be difficult to find. unclear that u have to click on ur name to view ur prfile

**#8: Aesthetic and minimalist design

Example: bad background design

**#9: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors

Example: required field*, internet connection warning, (404 error)

**#10: Help and documentation

Example: help page, faq form, search, find out more -- chat/online help, provide tour/training.
