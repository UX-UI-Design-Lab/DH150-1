Evaluation of **Venmo** and **Wescom Banking**
--------------------------------------------------

__#1: Visibility of system status__
> Venmo: Evaluation - 3
>> _Good_ - Loading sign when entering the app. The personal balance is apparent when user is confirming to pay to the recipient. Incomplete requests or payments to the user are noticeable.
>
>> _Bad_ - User's personal balance in Venmo should be more apparent (whether it be the first thing seen or putting it on the home page). The home page is always the user's friends' payments to other people; the purpose of Venmo is for the user to pay or receive money, and _the homescreen serves no purpose to accomplish these goals_. The homescreen should be the screen to pay and request people money, or the icon should be larger and more noticeable. The other options on the homescreen are a globe, where the user can see anyone's payments. This is unrelated to the user. The user can also click the single friend icon and see his or her own transactions. This seems like it is the user's profile, but it is not; the user can see transactions, but no total amount gained or lost, nor can he or she see their personal balance. 

__#2: Match between system and the real world__
> Venmo: Evaluation - 2
>> _Good_ - The buttons change color; when the user clicks the blue pay button, it changes to green for confirmation. When writing a pay or request sheet, the title will change to Pay or Request when the user clicks one of the options. When the user gets paid, the amount will be a + sign and green, and when the user pays someone, the amount will be - and red. The icons are recognizable and reflect their true function; for example, to pay or request, the top right button is a notepad with a $ sign on it and pencil to write. 
>
>>_Bad_ - The color of the buttons for pay and request are the same. The user may accidentally pay a friend when meaning to request from a friend, because both buttons are blue and change to green. It can be hard to notice that the title changed to Pay because the user's focus is more likely to be at the bottom of the screen and notice the color change, rather than the text change. The term "private" implies that all the information would be private from other users, however, private mode still shows the user's captions and who he or she interacted with. 

__#3: User control and freedom__
> Venmo: Evaluation - 2
>> _Good_ - The caption serves as a reminder to the user and recipient of the reason behind the transaction. This is helpful if the user forget why x amount of money was paid or requested. There is a clear cancel sign if the user decides he or she does not want to pay or request someone. There are no pop-up ads.
>
>>_Bad_ - The caption often autofills emojis whether the user would like that or not. It can be annoying to have to retype the caption or use a different word to avoid an emoji popping up. There is no option to save a draft. The user can easily cancel and discard a charge, however if he or she needs to go back to check the other person's username or recalculate the amount, the user must discard the working pay/request to go look through his or her friend list and then redraft a new pay/request (caption, amount, person). The user cannot cannot charge or pay multiple people; this makes it difficult on the user to have to remember who he or she has not paid/requested, the amount(s), and takes more time than necessary. Many people use Venmo when going out to eat with friends, and the person who paid will request their friends. If they split the bill equally, it becomes tedious for the user to charge the exact same amount to each person, as they have to create a new request each time.

__#4: Consistency and standards__
> Venmo: Evaluation - 1
>> _Good_ - The location of the buttons is consistent and the button icons are indicative of their functions. There is a side menu that indicates more menu options. The app is relatively intuitive to use. The user can swipe or tap to pull up the side menu and tap to change what the screen shows. 
>
>>_Bad_ - The user's personal profile and information is not as clear as seeing the user's friends'/community interactions. "Home" indicates that it would be the user's profile, but in fact the user must click his or her own name to reach their profile. "Home" brings the user to the homescreen which shows other people's transactions. 

__#5: Error prevention__
> Venmo: Evaluation - 2
>> _Good_ - Confirmation of last 4 digits of recipient's phone number when paying a significant amount to someone you are not Venmo "friends" with. There is a pay confirmation, request confirmation, and discard confirmation. 
>
>>_Bad_ - There is no confirmation of "Are you sure you want to send to x person?" when the recipient is friends with the user. The buttons for paying vs requesting are the same color, but it might be more helpful to have different colors. 

__#6: Recognition rather than recall__
> Venmo: Evaluation - 2
>> _Good_ - User's top people that he or she interacts with and friends show up as suggestions to pay. The user can also directly click the information button to view their profile.
>
>> _Bad_ - User must build up a network of friends before this function is available. A novice user will need to recall someone's user handle. If the user would like to pay or request someone who is not one of his or her "top friends," he or she will need to recall part of the recipient's name in order for the handle to pop up.

__#7: Flexibility and efficiency of use__
> Venmo: Evaluation - 2
>> _Good_ - There are functions to add/subtract and multiply/divide when making a Venmo pay or request. The user can also scan another Venmo user's code rather than type in the handle. It is also easy to add friends on Venmo, after knowing their handle.
>
>>_Bad_ - It can be difficult to find people on Venmo through typing their full name. It can be annoying to type someone's handle, because as more people use the app, more usernames are taken. Thus, many handle names include dashes and arbitrary numbers. The functions to do math (to figure out tax or splitting the bill, etc) are not prominent. Though they are right next to the numbers, it seems that many users are unaware that these functions actually work to benefit the user. However, I still see many users pulling out the calculator app to calculate the bill, which is inefficient. This indicates that the functions need to be more clear (bigger, different colors, or something). It is also unclear that the user must click on their name to view their profile and that the small button next to their photo is how to pull up the scan code. It can be more time consuming for the user, especially a novice user, to try and figure out these functions when trying to complete a transaction, because it was not clear enough.

__#8: Aesthetic and minimalist design__
> Venmo: Evaluation - 1
>> _Good_ -  The color scheme is consistent; the blue and white from the app icon is the same blue and white that shows up in the app. There are no distracting background colors; the header is blue, the screen is white, and the writing is in black and grey (and green and red for amounts). The visuals support the user goals and communicate function, indicating a high signal to noise ratio. The blue is nice to look at, and indicates trustworthiness which is important with monetary issues at hand. Additionally, blue is a commonly liked color, making it a safe choice for an app.

__#9: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors__
> Venmo: Evaluation - 2
>> _Good_ - A note/caption is required with each pay or request, so if a user tries to pay or request money without inserting a caption, a warning and example of a caption will pop up, preventing the user from following through with his or her actions, but also providing a solution. 
>
>>_Bad_ - There are no drafts to save. If the user starts a pay or request, there is no way to save the work on the charge and go back to the homescreen or other functions. If the user sends money to the wrong person, there is not much that can be done to reverse the error; there is no undo button, as the money has been sent already. The user can request that money back from the recipient, but relies on the recipient to return the money. 

__#10: Help and documentation__
> Venmo: Evaluation - 1
>> _Good_ - There is a clear help section in the sidebar menu that loads 3 options (Browse FAQs, Contact Us, and My Support Tickets). The user can search topics in the FAQs or scroll through popular topics and several articles. The FAQ seems to be organized well; there are sections regarding signing up, transferring to the bank, cards, payments and requests, etc. The user can click on an article and will be brought to a detailed page with bolded questions and answers. The Contact Us tab can redirect the user to the FAQs or the user can choose to email, chat, or call Venmo. It is also helpful that there is a tab to check the hours of operation of Venmo.
>
>>_Bad_ - Not entirely sure what "My Support Tickets" do; there is no explanation and nothing when the user clicks the tab because the user has no support tickets currently. Additionally, the "Chat with Us" tab does not seem to be working as it says it "could not connect, try again later."
