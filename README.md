Evaluation of **Venmo** and **Wescom Banking**
--------------------------------------------------

__#1: Visibility of system status__
Venmo: Evaluation - 3
> _Good_ - Loading sign when entering the app. The personal balance is apparent when user is confirming to pay to the recipient. 
> _Bad_ - User's personal balance in Venmo should be more apparent (whether it be the first thing seen or putting it on the home page). The home page is always the user's friends' payments to other people; the purpose of Venmo is for the user to pay or receive money, and _the homescreen serves no purpose to accomplish these goals_. The homescreen should be the screen to pay and request people money, or the icon should be larger and more noticeable. The other options on the homescreen are a globe, where the user can see anyone's payments. This is unrelated to the user. The user can also click the single friend icon and see his or her own transactions. This seems like it is the user's profile, but it is not; the user can see transactions, but no total amount gained or lost, nor can he or she see their personal balance. 


**#2: Match between system and the real world

Venmo: Evaluation - 2
> _Good_ - The buttons change color; when the user clicks the blue pay button, it changes to green for confirmation. When writing a pay or request sheet, the title will change to Pay or Request when the user clicks one of the options. When the user gets paid, the amount will be a + sign and green, and when the user pays someone, the amount will be - and red. The icons are recognizable and reflect their true function; for example, to pay or request, the top right button is a notepad with a $ sign on it and pencil to write. 
> _Bad_ - The color of the buttons for pay and request are the same. The user may accidentally pay a friend when meaning to request from a friend, because both buttons are blue and change to green. It can be hard to notice that the title changed to Pay because the user's focus is more likely to be at the bottom of the screen and notice the color change, rather than the text change. 

**#3: User control and freedom

bad - autofill emojis even when u dont want 
caption for pay to remind u later on what u paid for 
can discard a started charge but not save a draft - if user has calculated the amount and forgot the username, he or she will have restart if going to search for the other user
cannot charge or pay multiple people - many ppl use venmo when goign out to eat with friends and it can be annoying for the person who paid to have to charge the same amount to ppl and have to remember who thye havent charged yet.

**#4: Consistency and standards

Example: button label (login-), function of icon (go back to home), location of the icon/menu/layout

location of buttons always the smae

**#5: Error prevention

Venmo:
> _Good_ - Confirmation of last 4 digits of recipient's phone number when paying a significant amount to someone you are not Venmo "friends" with. discard confirmation. pay confirmation
bad - easy to mistype amount or forget the decimal 

**#6: Recognition rather than recall

> _Good_ - User's top people that he or she interacts with and friends show up as suggestions to pay. User can also directly click the information button to view their profile.
> _Bad_ - User must build up a network of friends before this function is available. A novice user will need to recall someone's user handle. 

**#7: Flexibility and efficiency of use

> Good - functions like adding or multiplying in the app and can quickly scan code rather than type
> Bad - these functions are not prominent and can be difficult to find. 

**#8: Aesthetic and minimalist design

Example: bad background design

**#9: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors

Example: required field*, internet connection warning, (404 error)

**#10: Help and documentation

Example: help page, faq form, search, find out more -- chat/online help, provide tour/training.
