### Intro
This project is about finding an easier way to handle finances, transactions, and budgeting easier. As a college student, I am interested in saving money, quickly paying my friends back or being paid back, and seeing how much money I have left to spend that day, week, month, or year. This application allows for all of these tasks to happen in one place rather than multiple apps or spreadsheet, making it easy to keep track of everything. The functions of this application cater to anyone looking for a simple way to record finances and transact money.

### Design Statement
Currently, Venmo is a smartphone application that allows people to transact money. Thus, as long as people have money in their account, people can go out without any cash or coins. There are many advantages to Venmo, such as paying or requesting someone exact cents and transfer money in or out of their bank account to their Venmo account, but there are some functions missing that would make the application more useful and efficient. For example, there is no way to see a sum of what you've paid versus requested, every transaction is its own separate entity. Additionally, it would be helpful to be able to record a picture of a receipt, rather than having a stack of receipts somewhere in a drawer. Finally, there should be a way that allows a user to charge the same amount to multiple people at once, rather than tediously repeating a pay or request to five people. The social aspect of Venmo seems to take away from the purpose of the application, so making the home screen centered on the user would be beneficial to helping the user see their finances. Rearranging some of the features to better serve user's needs and adding these functions would increase the usability and efficiency of Venmo.

### Competitor analysis: Heuristic Evaluation
I chose to focus my project on the finance and banking community, because Venmo and Wescom are apps that I personally use a lot. These applications are useful to anyone with a bank account, probably high schoolers and older.  I aim to recognize, detect, and analyze both applications following Jakob Nielsenâ€™s 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design to identify usability problems.

### Competitor analysis: Usability testing
I conducted a usability test to measure the usability of Venmo and to observe a user perform real tasks that the app is meant for. I wanted to understand a user's thought process when attempting different tasks and to measure the easiness and efficiency of Venmo. Specifically, I wanted to hear the thought process of another user when navigating Venmo to check basic information, calculate the bill on Venmo, and try to pay multiple people at once.

During this process, I learned some complications that a real user of Venmo experiences and what she would like to see to improve these issues. My participant was unable to charge the same amount to multiple people at once and expressed how it would be more efficient and convenient if Venmo were to have this function. Some basic features are not as noticeables as they should be. For example, there are basic calculator functions on Venmo, but often times users overlook the buttons and open a separate calculator app. She expressed how she liked the current app, but would like to see improvement.

### User research [contextual inquiry]:
This project will support user's financial needs, such as handling  budgeting and transactions. Current solutions satisfy basic transactions, but can be remade to be more efficient and expand to fit other uses. The features I want to add stem from my own use by myself and with friends. For this task, I interviewed a college student to better understand her needs and expectations from the app, so that I could evaluate what needed to be changed.
