---------------------------------
## Description ##
> This project aims to add useful functions to Venmo (an application that makes handling finances and transactions easier) and improve the user interface.  As a college student, I use Venmo a lot in transactions with friends and strangers. There are 
great existing functions, but the app is unable to perform tasks like charging or paying multiple people at once, recording a
receipt and who bought what item, and an easier way to visualize spending. Thus, this prototype aims to solve those three 
tasks as the purpose of this high-fidelity prototype is to create a interactive,functioning version of the product. First, I 
created a wireframe and wireflow, then learned how to use Adobe XD and installed a toolkit to achieve a more realistic iPhone 
look, and then digitized my wireframe and flow. By linking certain buttons, the prototype is interactive. Careful design and 
detail allows the application to appear as if it were reallistically being run on an iPhone. Then, I had a user do a test run,
to see if the three tasks worked and no dead ends were hit.

more opaque background when stuff pops up
white and blue did not have a high enough contrast so i went with a darker blue provided by a toolkit
i liked the white & blue and shades of grey because it is not too much color and very clean
gains and losses represented by green and red because it makes natural sense
i coded pay as green and request as red because it made sense and i talked to some other peers and they agreed that that makes natural sense, but the reverse might make more logical sense. perhaps they shouldnt be color coded, but i wanted a way to distinguish between the two buttons, as i ahve often pressed the wrong one.
i used a tool kit to make it more realistically like an iPhone 
the icons i used were from noun project and chose simple ones that would be easily recognized

+1: Thoughtful description about how you made the decisions for the graphical interface design (ex. Color scheme).
