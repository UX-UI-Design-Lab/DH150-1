# DH150 Assignment04 by Selina Pan

## Step01
My project aims to make exchanging money amongst friends or strangers even easier. Currently, there are several forms of transaction, such as ApplePay, PayPal, Venmo, check, credit cards, and cash. I want to make Venmo more efficient, as I think it has the potential to be the most common form of exchanging money. One limitation provided by Venmo is that users must rely on their bank funds, if there is no money in their account. This can be a hassle when a user is trying to pay back a friend and realizes that they actually do not have enough funds; they must transfer money from their bank or go find cash. Additionally, technology may not always be reliable; if there is a bug or hack into Venmo, users may lose their money. According to Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, this would be a safety need because this constitutes financial security.

## Step02

Step02: Target users 
What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise) 
Where would the users do that activity?
What would the users do to complete that activity? 

Step03: Pick an observation method (or a combination of methods) 
Interview with direct / Passive / Participatory observation* (recommended)
Or something you learned on your own (refer the field guideline by IDEO)

Step04: Plan to get into the context & write down the observation/ interview guide 
Decide where to visit
Decide what activities to observe/ what to ask to do
Decide how to interact with the users 
Decide how to collect user data (ex. Pen-paper notes, voice/video recording, images)
Prepare the interview guide (refer)

Step05: Conduct the research
Visit the place
Meet/Observe people/person
Collect the data

Step06: Organize/Documentation
In github (sub)repository assignment5, create one document (either README.md or .html)
Describe your project design challenge + target user (step1+2)
Describe your research methods and plan (step3)
Provide a link to your interview/observation guide (step4) 
Digitize your notes (scan/photo) and upload your data to github
Provide a link to your representative data file(s) (step5)
Provide a link to the transcript your interview (or meaningful dialogues/ talk-alouds during observation) 
Write a reflection
