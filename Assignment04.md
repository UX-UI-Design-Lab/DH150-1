### Step01
My project aims to make exchanging money amongst friends or strangers even easier. Currently, there are several forms of transaction, such as ApplePay, PayPal, Venmo, check, credit cards, and cash. I want to make Venmo more efficient, as I think it has the potential to be the most common form of exchanging money. One limitation provided by Venmo is that users must rely on their bank funds, if there is no money in their account. This can be a hassle when a user is trying to pay back a friend and realizes that they actually do not have enough funds; they must transfer money from their bank or go find cash. Additionally, technology may not always be reliable; if there is a bug or hack into Venmo, users may lose their money. According to Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, this would be a safety need because this constitutes financial security.

### Step02
Users are typically young adults and adults, ranging from high school to middle adged. All genders and races will find use in this product. It is family friendly, easy to use, and incredibly useful. There is no requirement of occupation or education to use this application. However, users do need a smartphone that can support the application and have money in their account to participate in payment transactions. At least 2 people need to be involved in a transaction. The most common uses of this application are going out to eat or selling/buying something from another person. Large businesses do not tend to use this transaction, but when, for example, a student user is looking to buy a used textbook for $50 from another student, Venmo is a common means to exchange money for product. Groups of friends may also go out to lunch or dinner together, and one person will pay for the check with their credit card, while the other friends will Venmo the payer their share of the bill. This is more efficient than asking to split the bill or trying to calculate exactly how much cash to leave. Thus, users may use this application outside, at restaurants or businesses, or at home alone. The two people do not need to be in the vicinity of each other to make payments, requests, or reminders. A user can be aware that they owe their friend $30, and pay their friend back whenever is best. If they need to transfer funds into their Venmo, they can do it, or if they've had a busy day, they can pay their friend back whenever is convenient. 

### Step03
Step03: Pick an observation method (or a combination of methods) 
Interview with direct / Passive / Participatory observation* (recommended)
Or something you learned on your own (refer the field guideline by IDEO)

### Step04
Step04: Plan to get into the context & write down the observation/ interview guide 
Decide where to visit
Decide what activities to observe/ what to ask to do
Decide how to interact with the users 
Decide how to collect user data (ex. Pen-paper notes, voice/video recording, images)
Prepare the interview guide (refer)


### Step05
Step05: Conduct the research
Visit the place
Meet/Observe people/person
Collect the data

### Step06
Step06: Organize/Documentation
In github (sub)repository assignment5, create one document (either README.md or .html)
Describe your project design challenge + target user (step1+2)
Describe your research methods and plan (step3)
Provide a link to your interview/observation guide (step4) 
Digitize your notes (scan/photo) and upload your data to github
Provide a link to your representative data file(s) (step5)
Provide a link to the transcript your interview (or meaningful dialogues/ talk-alouds during observation) 
Write a reflection
