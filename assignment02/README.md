# DH150 assignment 02 Usability testing

The purpose of this usability testing is to measure the usability of Venmo and to observe a user perform real tasks that the app is meant for. I created a Google Form questionnare/survey, along with bringing in a user to test run the application. This allowed me to hear the user's thought process and opinion of the application, so that I can improve the application later on to be better. Specifically, I wanted to hear the thought process of another user when navigating Venmo to check basic information, calculate the bill on Venmo, and try to pay multiple people at once.

During the pilot test, I realized some parts of my google form survey were not entirely correct. For example, I left some text as a description when I didn't mean to and I missed the "Agree" column for one question. These mistakes were careless, but probably due to the fact that I worked on this while I had the flu so I was not as detail oriented. Additionally, my test user was my mom, and while she is a user of Venmo, I believe the target audience is more people my age. I went home because I was sick so I could not ask anyone else to do it. In the future I will make sure to improve these materials when preparing for a UT. The video was easy to do on the computer, and I added sound to the screen record just in case something went wrong with the video. There were no issues in recording or going through the UT process. During this process, I learned some complications that a real user of Venmo experiences and what she would like to see to improve these issues. I think it was interesting to use my mom as a user because she comes from a computer background and has a pretty methodical approach to figuring something out.
