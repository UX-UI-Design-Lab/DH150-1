# DH150 assignment 02 Usability testing
## The purpose of this usability testing is to measure the usability of Venmo and to observe a user perform real tasks that the app is meant for. I created a Google Form questionnare/survey, along with bringing in a user to test run the application. This allowed me to hear the user's thought process and opinion of the application, so that I can improve the application later on to be better. Specifically, I wanted to hear the thought process of another user when navigating Venmo to check basic information, calculate the bill on Venmo, and try to pay multiple people at once.

One paragraph describing what you learned during the pilot test, what went well and what went not so well, focusing on how you want to improve your UT in the future.
